%% Clearing the Workspace
% It is good practice to write the following line of code at the start of
% each script. This removes old variables and closes any figures. 

% Clear Workspace
clear
% Clear the Command Window
clc
% Close any open figures
close all

%% Get User Input:
% Ask the user for the temperature as a "double", not a string. 
% (That's why there's no 's' in the input command)

temperatureValue = 

%% Compare the input to 32:
% Use an if-elseif-else conditional to compare below freezing, Exactly
% freezing, and Above freezing. (And to catch a potential error)
