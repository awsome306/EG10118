%% Variable Assignment Statements
% Enter the two temperature reading vectors as column vectors (i.e., these
% are 4 x 1 vectors). To create a column vector use semi-colons (;)
temperatureVec1_F = [39; 37; 42; 35];
temperatureVec2_F = [40; 34; 41; 32];

% Determine the number of sensors using the length function.


% Convert the temperatures to Celsius using scalar subtraction and
% multiplication of a vector
% degC = 9/5*degF +32


% To compute the average of each sensor value; you can add the two vectors
% together and then multiple the total vector by 0.5 (or divide by 2)


% Display the average temperature vector


% To compute the overall average of all four sensors, use a for loop to
% cycle through the sensors and add the values to the running total.

% Once you have the sum of the average of the four vectors, you can take
% the overall average of the four sensors by dividing by the number 
% of sensors. 


% Display the results
