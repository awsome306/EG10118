%% Instuctor Example 1: What does this do?
% An example from the beginning of class on Thursday.

clear, clc, close all

% Assigning "x" a value. What is the current value of x?
x = 0;
x = x+1;

% Assigning "y" a value. 
y = 3; 

% Assigning "z" a value. 
z = x-y;

% Pause. What variables do we have at this point? 
% What are the names and values of each variable?

% disp(x)
% disp(y)
% disp(z)

% Now let's assign new values to the variables.
x = 4;
y = sqrt(x);
z = abs(z);

% What will be displayed?
disp(x)
disp(y)
disp(z)
